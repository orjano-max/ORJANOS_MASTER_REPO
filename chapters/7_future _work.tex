% \subsection{Final Concept}\label{sec:M:CD:FinalConcept}

% The UR5 manipulator requires a dedicated controller to operate.This controller also contains the DC-power supply for the manipulator. As the manipulator is to be mounted on an UGV, this controller has to be powered through DC-power. According to the Universal Robots CB3 battery supply installation manual \cite{ur5_battery_manual}, the UR5 could draw up to 50A at "peak conditions". Looking at table \ref{tab:husky:a200:specs}, it is clear that the built in 24V power distribution on the Husky, with a 5A circuit breaker, is insufficient.
% %AJ can be skipped, directly to Interbotix. Better fit to future work

% The design of a mobile power system for the CB3 controller and thus, the UR5 manipulator is beyond the scope of this project. The decision was therefore made to swap out the UR5 manipulator with a smaller Interbotix VX300 manipulator from Trossen Robotics, illustrated in figure \ref{fig:M:CD:FC:VX300}. This is a significantly smaller robotic arm that is powered through 12V DC-power supply with a standard 2.5mm DC barrel jack. Some of it's key specifications is shown in table \ref{tab:M:CD:FC:VX300Specs}
