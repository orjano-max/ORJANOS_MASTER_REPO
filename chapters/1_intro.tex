\chapter{Introduction}

Autonomous robotics has been gaining massive traction over the last decade. This increased interest in autonomous robotics has sparked inventions like Robot Operating System(ROS). ROS, and its successor Robot Operating System 2(ROS 2), is an open source operating system made give developers the tools necessary to implement advanced robotic applications without the need for comprehensive knowledge about the inner workings of for example 3D Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) sensors or Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors(PMSM).  This opens the door to develop autonomous warehouse automation systems where autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles(UGV), could navigate a standard warehouse and fetch items using a mounted robotic manipulator. This thesis presents a proof of concept for using differential drive robots together with machine vision and robotic manipulators to preform autonomous warehouse automation tasks.
