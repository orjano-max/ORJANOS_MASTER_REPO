\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This thesis has been written as the final dissertation that marks the end of my Master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering. It has been an interesting, yet extensive and time-consuming project that has tested my knowledge. I would like to express my gratitude to UiA for providing me with the knowledge and tools necessary to tackle such a project through five years of Mechatronics engineering education. To my fellow students, especially the ones sharing offices with me while working on their own theses, at the Mechatronics Master Lab: Congratulations, we pushed through it and can now call ourselves "Sivilingeniør".

I would also like to give a special thanks my supervisors throughout this project, Ajit Jha and Ilya Tyapin, for supervisory advice to practical problems that have occurred during the project, as well as guidance related to the writing of this thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for supporting me throughout these five years of studying Mechatronics engineering at the University of Agder.
