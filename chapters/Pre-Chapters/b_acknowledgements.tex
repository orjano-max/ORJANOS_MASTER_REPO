\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This thesis has been written as the final dissertation that marks the end of my Master's degree in Mechatronics Engineering. This has been an interesting, but extensive and time-consuming project where my knowledge has been tested. I would like to thank UiA, for giving the knowledge and tools to solve such a project like this. Ans I would also like to give a special thanks my supervisors throughout this project, Ajit Jha and Ilya Tyapin, for their help and guidance during the course of this thesis. Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for supporting me throughout the course of these five years of studying Mechatronics at the University of Agder.
